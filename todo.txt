x Select background image
x change index.html to have a debug / release mode (perhaps add both and remove unneeded)
x remove access token from hash
  x pushstate? no replaceState :)
* isReverse doesn't work properly
x configuration for debug / live in Grunt
* animation when solved
x make status-image clickable
* router instead of statemachine
* animate route changes (tree structure)
* cleanup css
  * use grunt task for this? rather also remove it from the source not only the dist
* cleanup js
* Solve the puzzle
* Puzzle status (e.g. moves made, minimum moves left)
* jQuery.extend
* maccaw events
  * Events only work when their state is active
* favicon changes based on state of the puzzle
* add state of the puzzle to the url
  * both bg and game state?
* something with the z-index (when moving tiles the shadow is not always correct)
* animate the background changing
* CORS is now possible looking at the headers used on the fbcdn
* 3x3 and 5x5
x set background should be scrollable
  x make it more fluid on the iphone (scrollbar is also invisible)
    x always have the scrollbar on the body, so use default browser behaviour
* set background should show more than 20 pictures
  * i think popular only supports 20? or perhaps try the count parameter?
    * count parameter works
    * but is there a maxid?
    * for now 40 everywhere but I don't like that
* clean up gruntfile
  * use env?
* use templates in the html instead of defining the instagram pages 4 times
* create a subclass of Page to be used for instagram pages
