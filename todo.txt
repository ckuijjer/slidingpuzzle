* something when solved :)
* animation when solved
* fallback if the image 404's
* load/store the palette in localStorage
* router instead of statemachine
	* animate route changes (tree structure)
* cleanup css
  * use grunt task for this? rather also remove it from the source not only the dist
  * probably a need to move through the app as some classes are added dynamically
    * automated testing?
* cleanup js
* Solve the puzzle
* Puzzle status (e.g. moves made, minimum moves left)
* favicon changes based on state of the puzzle
* add state of the puzzle to the url
  * both bg and game state?
* something with the z-index (when moving tiles the shadow is not always correct)
  * happens when moving up or down
* animate the background changing
* 3x3 and 5x5
* set background should show more than 20 pictures
  * i think popular only supports 20? or perhaps try the count parameter?
    * count parameter works
    * but is there a maxid?
    x for now 40 everywhere but I don't like that
* clean up gruntfile
* use env?
* use templates in the html instead of defining the instagram pages 4 times
* jQuery.extend
* maccaw events
  * Events only work when their state is active
* create a subclass of Page to be used for instagram pages
